hmm, so now we want to be able to give a directory
like
mystuff post handler
and have that apply to any files under there
and maybe any directories? i think that would make sense.
for now let's do one level.

also i feel like the routes could be a better object, let's write that first.]

//ok, can we write a function that says, requested url is this?

//idea from bethany, use a json object
//var allowedRoutes = {
//    "/" : "POST",
//    "/" : "GET"
//    "/" : {
//        "GET" : function myhanderfunction() {},
//        "POST" : getsomefu
//
////    }
//}
//
//allowedRoutes["/"]["PUT"] = anotherFunction
//allowedRoutes["/foo"] == null
//
//
//object["a"] //=> "apple"

//CODE IS a BIG MESS WILL BE CLEANED UP!!!

//how to generalize this so we can get set the path ourselves.
//start by setting the path in a variable.
//for this route
//if the request is get
//then do this
//if the request is post
//then do this

//
//var allowedroutes = {
//    myhanderfunction : function
//}
